# ðŸš¨ Fix GitHub Pages 404 Error

## **STEP 1: Verify GitHub Pages Settings**

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/galvaro94/Implementing-Data-Governance-Game-Week-2/settings/pages

2. **CHECK THESE SETTINGS**:
   - âœ… **Source**: Must be "**GitHub Actions**" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - âœ… **Custom domain**: Should be **empty** (leave blank)
   - âœ… **Enforce HTTPS**: Should be **checked**

3. **If source is wrong**: Change to "GitHub Actions" and click **Save**

## **STEP 2: Run the New Workflow**

1. **Go to Actions**: https://github.com/galvaro94/Implementing-Data-Governance-Game-Week-2/actions

2. **Click "Deploy to Pages"** (new workflow)

3. **Click "Run workflow"** â†’ Select "main" â†’ **Run workflow**

4. **Wait for completion** (2-3 minutes)

## **STEP 3: Check for Common Issues**

### **A. Repository Visibility**
- Repository MUST be **public** for free GitHub Pages
- Go to Settings â†’ Scroll to bottom â†’ "Change repository visibility"

### **B. Branch Check**
- After successful deployment, check if `gh-pages` branch exists
- Go to your repo â†’ Click branches dropdown â†’ Should see `gh-pages`

### **C. Workflow Permissions** (You already did this)
- Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General â†’ "Read and write permissions" âœ…

## **STEP 4: Alternative URLs to Try**

If main URL fails, try these:

1. **With index.html**: https://galvaro94.github.io/Implementing-Data-Governance-Game-Week-2/index.html

2. **Wait 10 minutes** then try original URL (DNS propagation delay)

## **STEP 5: Manual Build Test**

Test if the build works locally:

```bash
cd "/Users/gabrielalvaro/GovEx Academy Game - DM1 2025"
npm run build
# Should create dist/ folder with index.html
```

## **ðŸ†˜ IMMEDIATE FIX CHECKLIST**

- [ ] Repository is **public**
- [ ] Go to Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source: "**GitHub Actions**" â†’ Save
- [ ] Run "**Deploy to Pages**" workflow manually
- [ ] Wait for **green checkmark**
- [ ] Try URL again: https://galvaro94.github.io/Implementing-Data-Governance-Game-Week-2/

## **ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result**

After fixing, you should see your game's team selection screen with:
- JHU logo
- "Implementing Data Governance"
- 8 team selection buttons
- Language toggle (EN/ES/PT)

---

**If still 404 after these steps, the issue is likely DNS propagation. Wait 30 minutes and try again.**
